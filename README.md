# inventory

The Bushwick Food Coop inventory app.

## Notes

It is worth noting that, as of 5/14/18, the Food Co-op's iPads are still running an outdated version of Safari that cannot interpret ES6 syntax - unless you're sure that the iPad browsers are up to date, this app's JavaScript needs to be written in ES5.

This app's JavaScript files have been (mostly) linted according to ESLint's [eslint-config-airbnb-base] rules
